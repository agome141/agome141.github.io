                  <p>
                     For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), however, representation in American cinema has not always been inclusive or reflective of their multifaceted communities.

                  <p>
                     Beef creates commanding television by twisting the idea of a fateful encounter. Usually, when humans talk about chance meetings with other humans, we think of the positive.

                     Today, Disney+ and Lucasfilm announced that the second volume of the animated anthology series will premiere May 4, 2023, a.k.a. Star Wars Day, exclusively on Disney+.

                  <p>
                     And that’s the key for me. A quick search of Asian-led films shows you just how narrow in scope they’ve been in the past, tending to fall under one of three categories: comedy, drama or romance, and this includes my beloved Crazy Rich Asians.

                  <p>
                     In many courses (and I’ll use mine as an example), Asian cinema courses have mostly focused on East Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea.
